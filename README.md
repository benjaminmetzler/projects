# Miscellaneous Projects

This is a collection of small projects that I am working on but don't warrant their own repos.

## Current Projects
1. My Push-To-Talk button instructions
2. start_blink.* - Couple of tiny scripts that can be use cause a [fit-statUSB](https://fit-iot.com/web/product/fit-statusb/) to blink, e.g. via an Outlook notification.
3. The TidBITS Autocorrect Dictionary in [espanso](https://espanso.org) format.
